Hybrid Movie Recommender System
Overview

This project implements a hybrid movie recommendation system that combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. Deep learning methods are incorporated to improve prediction accuracy and personalization. The system aims to provide users with highly relevant movie suggestions based on their preferences and past ratings.

Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked based on movie metadata (genres, actors, plot keywords).
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user ratings and interactions to find patterns and recommend movies liked by similar users.
Hybrid Approach: Combines both techniques to improve recommendation accuracy and diversity.
Scalable: Designed to handle large datasets of movies and user interactions.

Technologies Used
Python – main programming language
Pandas, NumPy – data processing
Scikit-learn – similarity calculations and evaluation metrics
TensorFlow / PyTorch – deep learning models for enhanced predictions
Jupyter Notebook – experimentation and prototyping
